description: '"Every woman needs a little black dress," goes the phrase attributed to Coco Channel. In content marketing, every brand needs video. Video has become ubiquitous in the digital world with most platforms offering some kind of video capability (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and of course YouTube). It used to be that one would produce a video, edit that video and then upload the video (to YouTube or Vimeo) for distribution. While this is still good practice for videos that require higher production values, the trend today is live video broadcasting. All businesses, especially those targeting the consumer or the traveler should come up with a video and live video strategy to stay competitive in the content marketing wars.'
